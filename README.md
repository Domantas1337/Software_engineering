# Software engineering class project: environment, recycling

## About
Not knowing where the nearest recycle bin or taromat is can cause littering, so to prevent that, we have decided to create a geolocation based app that enables users to report the locations of these objects by creating markers on the map.

## Features
1. User orientation on the map
2. Create and/or update markers (bins, taromats, litter)
3. Navigate to selected markers
4. Report system for false markers
