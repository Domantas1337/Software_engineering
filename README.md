# Software engineering class project: environment, recycling

## About
Not knowing where the nearest recycle bin or taromat is can cause littering, so to prevent that, we have decided to create a geolocation based app that enables users to report the locations of these objects by creating markers on the map.

## Features
1. User orientation on the map
2. Create and/or update markers (bins, taromats, litter)
3. Navigate to selected markers
4. Report system for false markers
5. Announcement board system
    1. header, body, location of annoucement
    2. participate option
    3. comments
    4. bad word filters
6. Navigation search bar
